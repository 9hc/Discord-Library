**Discord Library** is a Discord bot dedicated to bumping servers on our public list, which is in our server. The bot is still in WIP, so there is no such link to add it to your server yet.

The bot is open source for anyone willing to modify the code for **public use**! Please check the [license](https://github.com/Deivedux/Discord-Library/blob/master/license.md) for more information.
